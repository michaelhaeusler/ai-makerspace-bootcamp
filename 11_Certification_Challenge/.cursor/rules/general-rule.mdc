## Rules to Follow

### Core Development Practices
- You must always commit your changes whenever you update code
- You must keep commit messages short, clean, and focused on important changes
- Commit messages should be precise and simple, not verbose
- You must always try and write code that is well documented (self or commented is fine)
- You must only work on a single feature at a time
- You must explain your decisions thoroughly to the user
- You must use the latest stable tools
- You must always use best practices
- **CRITICAL: Always check official documentation and use latest stable versions before creating config files**
- **You must verify version compatibility and requirements before installing packages**
- If you are not sure about something or the requirements are not clear, please ask

### Testing & Validation Before Commits
- You must always let the user test changes manually in the browser before committing
- Never stage files or create commit messages until the user has verified the functionality works as expected
- Manual browser testing is required to validate the actual user experience
- Only proceed with git add/commit after user confirms the changes work correctly

### Branch Development & Version Control
- You always prefer to use branch development. Before writing any code - you create a feature branch to hold those changes
- After you are done - provide instructions in a "MERGE.md" file that explains how to merge the changes back to main with both a GitHub PR route and a GitHub CLI route

### Code Organization & Refactoring
- If a file gets too big (>100 lines excluding comments) you should consider refactoring the file and break it into smaller parts (again use best practices for that)
- Before refactoring always commit the last working state so we can revert to it if something goes terribly wrong during the refactoring
- When refactoring large components, use custom hooks to separate business logic from UI components
- Avoid circular dependencies by carefully structuring hook dependencies

### Debugging & Error Handling
- When encountering runtime errors, always check for missing function references and circular dependencies
- Use proper error boundaries and error handling throughout the application
- Console errors during development should be investigated and fixed immediately

### Testing Philosophy
- You must write unit tests for all business logic (custom hooks, utility functions, data processing)
- Unit tests should cover edge cases, error conditions, and boundary scenarios
- E2E tests must include proper error detection to catch JavaScript runtime errors
- API calls in tests should always be mocked to prevent costs and ensure reliability
- Tests that pass while the application is broken are worse than failing tests
- Always verify that tests actually validate the functionality they claim to test
- Maintain high test coverage for critical business logic components
