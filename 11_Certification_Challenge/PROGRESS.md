# InsuranceLens Development Progress

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
AI-powered German health insurance policy assistant with RAG, clause highlighting, and intelligent Q&A.

## 📋 **Current Phase: Phase 1 - Backend Core**

### **Phase 1: Backend Core (Day 1)**
- [ ] **PDF Processing Service** - Extract text from uploaded PDFs
- [ ] **Qdrant Integration** - Store policy chunks in vector database  
- [ ] **Basic RAG Pipeline** - Retrieve relevant chunks for questions

### **Phase 2: AI Agent Logic (Day 2)**
- [ ] **LangGraph Agent** - Route questions (policy vs general)
- [ ] **Policy Q&A** - Answer questions with citations
- [ ] **Web Search Integration** - Tavily for general insurance questions
- [ ] **Clause Highlighting** - Compare policy vs norms

### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration (Day 3)**
- [ ] **Connect APIs** - Wire up all endpoints
- [ ] **Real-time Q&A** - Working question interface
- [ ] **Polish & Testing** - Error handling, loading states

## ✅ **Completed Tasks**

### **Project Setup (COMPLETED)**
- [x] Python backend with FastAPI, LangGraph, Qdrant dependencies
- [x] Next.js frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Modern uv + .venv dependency management
- [x] API structure with health, policies, questions routes
- [x] Pydantic schemas for type safety
- [x] German health insurance norms seed data (15 reference standards)
- [x] File upload component with progress tracking
- [x] Policy analysis tabs (Übersicht, Highlights, Fragen)
- [x] Complete documentation and setup guides
- [x] **Norms indexing script** - Successfully indexed norms into Qdrant

## 🚧 **Currently Working On**

### **Phase 1.2: VectorStore Service**
**Goal:** Store policy chunks in Qdrant with embeddings and enable retrieval

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create VectorStore service class
- [ ] Implement chunk storage with embeddings
- [ ] Add retrieval functionality
- [ ] Test PDF processing + storage pipeline

## 📝 **Notes & Decisions**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- Using **uv + .venv** for modern Python dependency management
- **FastAPI** for backend with automatic OpenAPI docs
- **Qdrant** for vector storage with OpenAI embeddings
- **LangGraph** for AI agent orchestration
- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript for frontend

### **Data Flow**
1. User uploads PDF → Extract text → Chunk with tiktoken → Embed with OpenAI → Store in Qdrant
2. User asks question → Classify question type → Retrieve relevant chunks → Generate answer with citations

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

**IMMEDIATE:** Start implementing PDF processing service
- Create `app/services/pdf_processor.py`
- Add PDF text extraction with pypdf/pymupdf
- Implement semantic chunking
- Test with sample PDF
