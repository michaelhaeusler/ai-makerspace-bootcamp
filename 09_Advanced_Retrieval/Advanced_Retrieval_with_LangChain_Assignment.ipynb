        "- large chunks reduce precision in retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "To get better results we could:\n",
        "- use gradient as threshold method because it detects sharp changes in similarity, even when overall similarity is high\n",
        "- adjust the threshold parameter to make it more sensitive -> creates more and smaller chunks\n",
