        "There are several problems with short, repetetive sentences (like FAQs) and semantic chunking:\n",
        "- similar semantic content, so similarity scores are consistently high\n",

        "- large chunks reduce precision in retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "To get better results we could:\n",
        "- use gradient as threshold method because it detects sharp changes in similarity, even when overall similarity is high\n",

        "## Retrieval Method Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "After evaluating six different retrieval methods using RAGAS metrics and LangSmith operational data, **BM25 emerges as the best overall choice** for this dataset when considering the balance of performance, cost, and latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance Analysis (RAGAS):**\n",
        "BM25 achieved the highest context precision (0.8542) while maintaining strong context recall (0.8403). This means it retrieves highly relevant documents while still capturing most of the ground truth information. The Ensemble method had the highest recall (0.8750) but significantly lower precision, and the Parent Document method had the best faithfulness (0.8885) but similar precision to BM25.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cost and Latency Analysis (LangSmith):**\n",
        "BM25 is extremely cost-effective at $0.00022 per query (total cost $0.0011 divided by 5 queries) and has the fastest response time at 1.559 seconds P50 latency. This makes it the most efficient option operationally.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why BM25 Works Well Here:**\n",
        "The dataset appears to contain structured project descriptions with clear domain-specific terminology. BM25's bag-of-words approach excels at matching exact terms and phrases, which is particularly effective for this type of content where specific project domains, technologies, and concepts need to be precisely matched.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Trade-offs Considered:**\n",
        "While Ensemble retrieval had the highest recall, it comes at 2.5x the cost and nearly 3x the latency of BM25. The Contextual Compression method had similar costs to BM25 but lower performance across all metrics. The Multi-Query approach showed promise but was slower and more expensive without significant performance gains.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this dataset, BM25 provides the optimal balance of high precision, good recall, low cost, and fast response times. The method's strength in exact term matching aligns well with the structured nature of the project data."
