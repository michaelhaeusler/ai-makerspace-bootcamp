    "   - Adapts to different types of research (comparisons, lists, deep dives, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallel Execution**\n",
    "   - Multiple researchers work simultaneously on different aspects\n",

    "   - Configurable parallelism (1-20 concurrent researchers)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ReAct Pattern for Quality**\n",

    "   - Natural stopping conditions based on information sufficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexible Tool Integration**\n",
    "   - Easy to add MCP tools for specialized research\n",
    "   - Supports multiple search APIs (Anthropic, Tavily)\n",
    "   - Each researcher can use different tool combinations\n",

       "# Comprehensive Analysis of NBER Working Paper \"How People Use ChatGPT\"\n",
       "\n",
       "## Executive Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "The NBER Working Paper No. 34255 \"How People Use ChatGPT\" by Aaron Chatterji et al. represents the most comprehensive analysis to date of how people actually use AI chatbots. Published in September 2025, this groundbreaking study documents ChatGPT's unprecedented growth from launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it reached approximately 10% of the world's adult population with over 700 million weekly active users [1]. Using privacy-preserving automated classification methods, the researchers analyzed 1.5 million conversations to reveal fundamental insights about AI adoption patterns, demographic shifts, and usage behaviors that challenge conventional assumptions about how AI is integrated into daily life.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Main Findings About AI Usage Patterns\n",
       "\n",
       "### Unprecedented Growth and Adoption Statistics\n",
       "\n",
       "ChatGPT achieved the fastest global technology diffusion in recorded history. From its launch on November 30, 2022, it reached one million users by December 5th and hit 100 million weekly active users by early November 2023—less than one year after release [3]. By July 2025, the platform served over 700 million weekly active users processing more than 2.6 billion messages daily (over 30,000 messages per second) [3][6]. This had grown to more than 750 million weekly active users by September 2025 [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "The growth trajectory shows remarkable acceleration, with weekly active users doubling every 7-8 months since reaching the 100 million milestone [3][6]. Total message volume increased 5.8x in the final year of the study period while the user base grew 3.2x, indicating that existing users are engaging more intensively as they gain experience with the technology [3][6]. To put this in historical perspective, ChatGPT reached 1 billion messages in December 2024—less than two years after launch—while Google search took eight years to reach 1 billion daily searches after its 1999 public release [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Demographic Evolution and Patterns\n",
       "\n",
       "The study reveals dramatic demographic shifts that challenge initial adoption patterns. Early adopters were overwhelmingly male, with more than 80% of initial users having typically male first names [3][5]. However, this gender gap closed rapidly, achieving near parity by early 2025 with 52% of active users having typically female first names by July 2025 [3][5][6]. This represents one of the most significant demographic reversals in technology adoption history.\n",
       "\n",
       "Age distribution shows strong skewing toward younger users, with nearly half of all messages coming from users under 26 years old [1][6][8]. Adults aged 18-25 are responsible for almost half of the platform's 2.6 billion daily messages as of July 2025, suggesting this generation is becoming \"truly AI native\" [6][8].\n",
       "\n",
       "Geographic adoption patterns reveal higher growth rates in lower-income countries compared to wealthy nations. Usage increased 3x in countries from the richest decile but grew 5-6x in middle-income countries [3]. This has resulted in similar usage rates across countries with vastly different GDP per capita levels—Brazil, South Korea, and the US now show comparable adoption despite economic differences [3]. The data indicates minimal difference in ChatGPT usage between countries at the 50th versus 90th percentile of GDP per capita [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Fundamental Shift from Work to Non-Work Usage\n",
       "\n",
       "Perhaps the most significant finding is the dramatic shift in usage patterns from work-related to personal applications. Non-work-related messages grew from 53% of total usage in mid-2024 to over 70% by mid-2025 [1][2][4]. This shift represents a fundamental change in how AI chatbots are being integrated into daily life, with personal and home production uses growing faster than professional applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "Work usage remains concentrated among educated users in highly-paid professional occupations, but represents only about 30% of messages on the consumer platform [4][7]. The decrease in work-related message share is primarily driven by changing usage patterns within existing user cohorts rather than compositional changes in new users [2][4]. This finding has profound implications for economic analysis, suggesting that AI's impact on unpaid activities and home production may be as large or larger than its workplace productivity effects.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Most Common Use Cases and Applications\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Three Dominant Categories\n",
       "\n",
       "The automated classification system revealed that nearly 80% of all ChatGPT conversations fall into three primary categories: Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing [1][2][4][6]. This concentration indicates that despite AI's theoretical versatility, actual usage patterns are remarkably focused on specific high-value applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Practical Guidance** accounts for 29% of all messages and remained stable at this level between July 2024 and July 2025 [6][8]. This category encompasses tutoring and teaching, how-to advice across various domains, and creative ideation. Messages in this category tend to be highly personalized, such as \"I'm a 65-year-old who hurt my left hamstring. Give me some stretches to do\" [8]. The stability of this usage category suggests it represents a core value proposition that users consistently find valuable.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Seeking Information** grew significantly from 14% to 24% of messages between July 2024 and July 2025 [8]. This category functions essentially as a replacement for traditional search engines but with the advantage of providing direct answers without requiring users to scroll through multiple websites [8]. The rapid growth in this category indicates users are increasingly treating ChatGPT as their primary information retrieval tool.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Writing** decreased from 36% to 24% of messages over the study period but remains critical, especially for work-related tasks [8]. Contrary to expectations about generating original content, approximately 66% of writing-related requests involve modifying existing text through editing, critiquing, summarizing, or translating rather than creating new content from scratch [6]. This category includes automated production of emails and documents but emphasizes ChatGPT's unique ability to manipulate and refine textual content compared to traditional search tools.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Work vs. Non-Work Context Analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "In work contexts, Writing dominates usage patterns, accounting for 40% of work-related messages in June 2025 [1]. This reflects ChatGPT's particular strength in producing digital outputs that can be directly integrated into professional workflows. Work-related usage is characterized by more task-oriented interactions, with \"Doing\" (requesting specific outputs) increasing to approximately 56% compared to 40% overall [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "The concentration of work usage among educated, highly-paid professionals suggests that AI chatbots are particularly valuable for knowledge work that involves information synthesis, analysis, and communication. However, the cross-occupational analysis reveals that people in different professions—teachers, salespeople, managers, engineers—use ChatGPT in broadly similar ways, primarily for information gathering, analysis, and decision support rather than profession-specific tasks [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Specialized Use Cases\n",
       "\n",
       "Computer programming accounts for only 4.2% of requests, significantly lower than many observers expected given early speculation about coding applications [5][6]. Education represents a more substantial use case with 10% of all requests involving tutoring or teaching [6]. Self-expression represents a relatively small share of overall usage [2][4].\n",
       "\n",
       "The mapping of work-related messages to O*NET occupational categories reveals that \"documenting/recording information\" and \"making decisions and solving problems\" emerge as top messaging categories across nearly every occupation [8]. Notably, even for educators, the primary use case isn't \"training and teaching others\" but \"documenting/recording information,\" and for sales occupations, the top task is \"making decisions and solving problems\" rather than \"selling or influencing others\" [8].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Trends and Patterns from the Data\n",
       "\n",
       "### User Intent Framework Evolution\n",
       "\n",
       "The researchers developed a comprehensive taxonomy showing that user messages fall into three primary intent categories: Asking (49%), Doing (40%), and Expressing (11%) [6][7]. \"Asking\" involves seeking information or advice for decision support and represents the dominant use case, having grown relatively faster than other categories [7]. \"Doing\" involves requesting specific outputs or task completion, while \"Expressing\" encompasses sharing views or feelings without seeking information or action.\n",
       "\n",
       "This framework reveals a fundamental shift from automation-focused interactions to advisory-type interactions, indicating that users increasingly view ChatGPT as a consultation tool rather than a direct task executor [9]. The dominance of \"Asking\" suggests that ChatGPT's primary economic value lies in decision support rather than task automation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Behavioral Changes Within User Cohorts\n",
       "\n",
       "The study provides unique insights into how individual users' behavior evolves over time. Usage patterns remained relatively flat through most of 2024 but increased substantially beginning in late 2024 to early 2025 across all signup cohorts [3]. Users who signed up in Q3 and Q4 2024 were sending nearly twice as many messages per day by 2025 as they did initially [3]. Early adopters from Q1 2023 were sending 40% more messages per day by July 2025 than they did two years earlier [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "This behavioral evolution suggests that ChatGPT has become substantially better and more user-friendly, leading to increased engagement among existing users rather than just new user acquisition driving growth [3]. The pattern indicates that users develop deeper integration of AI tools into their daily routines over time, finding new applications and becoming more comfortable with the technology.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Economic Value Creation Patterns\n",
       "\n",
       "User satisfaction metrics indicate positive interactions outnumber negative ones by approximately 4:1 [1]. The research suggests significant consumer surplus is being created, with users likely willing to pay substantially more than current subscription fees for the value they receive [7]. This economic value may not immediately appear in GDP or productivity statistics but represents substantial welfare benefits to users [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "The study concludes that ChatGPT's strongest economic value proposition is as a decision-support tool, particularly important for knowledge-intensive work [1][2][4]. Rather than replacing human capabilities, the technology appears to be augmenting human decision-making processes across both professional and personal contexts.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Geographic and Socioeconomic Trends\n",
       "\n",
       "The faster adoption in middle-income countries compared to high-income countries suggests that AI tools may have particularly high value in contexts where access to expert advice or information has been more limited [3]. The convergence in usage rates across countries with different economic development levels indicates that AI tools may help democratize access to certain types of knowledge and assistance.\n",
       "\n",
       "The concentration of work usage among educated professionals while non-work usage grows broadly across demographics suggests different value propositions for different user segments. Professional users appear to value productivity enhancement, while general consumers are finding value in personal assistance and entertainment applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Implications for Future AI Development\n",
       "\n",
       "The findings have significant implications for understanding the trajectory of AI integration into society. The study establishes that this generation of young adults is becoming truly AI-native, with usage patterns suggesting deep integration into daily decision-making processes [8]. The shift toward advisory rather than automation uses indicates that future AI development should focus on improving consultation and decision-support capabilities.\n",
       "\n",
       "The research methodology itself sets new standards for privacy-preserving analysis of sensitive user data, demonstrating how comprehensive insights can be generated while maintaining strict privacy protections [3]. The Data Clean Room approach enabled analysis of 1.5 million conversations without researchers ever accessing individual user messages or personal information [3][9].\n",
       "\n",
       "The study represents ground truth data on actual LLM usage patterns, moving beyond speculation to provide evidence-based insights about how AI technologies are being integrated into human activities [9]. These findings suggest that the next decade of software development will be significantly influenced by the advisory model of AI interaction rather than pure automation approaches.\n",
